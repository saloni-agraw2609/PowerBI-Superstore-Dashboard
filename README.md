Superstore Sales Dashboard
This repository contains an interactive dashboard built using Power BI (or Tableau) that provides insights into the sales and profit performance of a Superstore dataset. The dashboard visualizes sales and profit by different dimensions such as Month, Region, and Category, helping business users identify trends and patterns.

Insights
Sales and profit peaked in October and December, indicating strong year-end performance possibly driven by festive season demand.

The West region generated the highest sales and profit overall, making it the top-performing region.

Technology emerged as the most profitable category, while Furniture had lower profits despite moderate sales.

The Central and South regions showed decent sales, but profit margins were lowerâ€”possibly due to higher discounting or operational costs.
